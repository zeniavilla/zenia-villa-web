      "I joined the IBM Aspera team as it was in the beginning stages of Aspera on Cloud (AoC), a SaaS file transfer application. After doing some server-side work for web apps Faspex and Files, I had the opportunity to build features on the client-side and quickly joined the front-end development team. Throughout my time at Aspera, I've moved through the pipeline (pun intended) of fixing small bugs to implementing major features and being an active part of design-development discussions (I love accidental alliteration).",
      "Recently, the front-end team has expanded into working on Faspex, which involves building new features that fully utilize the Carbon Design System. In a typical week, I'll work in tandem with members of the design, back-end, devtest, and/or microcopy teams. From time to time, I fix critical bugs that may come up in production. I also stay actively involved in design reviews."

      "Coding had been on my mind since I took a Computer Science class in high school. After creating the website for AMCT Design using Joomla and customizing the client-side code, I took a few online classes and kept wondering if I could make it a career. My career had taken me down a path that left me feeling unchallenged. With the support of my family, I stopped working and started to learn how to code in JavaScript. I paid for various types of memberships including Code School and Learn.co and found some strucutre to learn JS, Ruby on Rails, and React. It was 8+ days five days a week for seven months and then applying aggressively. I ended up moving to the Bay area after accepting a role at IBM and it ended up being the best opportunity."
