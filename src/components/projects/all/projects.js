          "The project was first introduced as a customer request. Given its elaborate architecture and the number of teams individuals, collaboration and communication were my biggest contributions. The Frontend code was rather straightforward, which included form and admin settings changes, but I was able to flex other muscles such as staying in constant contact with the Designer and Tech Writer assigned to the project, as there were many design iterations.",
          "One design proposal that didn't make it to implementation was the option to create a Key Management Service profile within the form of a Node creation/update. This design pattern didn't exist anywhere else in the apps and would have involved extra work to create a POST call, handling errors so as not to destroy the user's filled out form, and rethinking other pages that might adopt this pattern. In the end, we decided if was too much of an effort for the project scope and not enough of an impact."

          "This involved the BE team creating an API endpoint within the AoC infrastructure that would contain basic data. That basic data would allow the UI to display an initial rendering, make calls to get file info from our Node API, and do a final render to display updated information (name and size may have changed, for example). It was important to make async calls to gather the more detailed file information from the Node so as not to block the DOM instead of combining both calls together."

In a cross-team effort to improve site performance and reliability, we decided to move away from polling.
